an haskell file storage access, make handling of your local files more approachable

### base idea
Using hierarchical filesystem managers is not optimal, especially as we got more and more used to search engines and more powerful tools to categorize data.

This application's goal would be to allow users to easily catalogue and retrieve documents on the hard-disk without having to come up with their own logic to separate files into folders and subfolders. The aim for such a tool is to make it simpler to attach `labels` to the document so that the labeling should make it easier to find the file later, making it less relevant to keep in mind the document name, or the original intent behind the choice of folders.

Multiple tagging should enable the user to find documents using multiple axis of search.

Additional features yet-to-be-investigated might help out the process of labeling, helping the user to invest less time in pointless organization of the tree structure.
